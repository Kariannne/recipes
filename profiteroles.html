    <h2>Make delicious profiteroles!</h2>
    <p>
      Oh-so delicious and impressive, too. Choux pastry is not difficult to make
      if the recipe is followed carefully. It is important to add the sifted
      flour all at once, so the mixture does not become lumpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were taught at college, we were told to ‘shoot’ the flour in,
      which explains it well. Piled in a wonderful pyramid and scattered with
      spun sugar, this simple bun becomes the celebrated wedding cake,
      croquembouche.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>50g butter</li>
      <li>150ml water</li>
      <li>75g plain flour</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>200ml double cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/Gas 7 and line a baking sheet with
        non-stick baking paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the butter and water in a small saucepan over a high heat and cook
        until the water is boiling and the butter has melted. Remove from the
        heat and immediately shoot in the flour, all at once. Quickly beat with
        a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together and makes a smooth,
        thick dough. Add the beaten egg, a little at a time, beating after each
        addition, until the egg is incorporated and the dough is thick and
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon 12 domes of pastry on to the baking sheet. Brush with the extra
        beaten egg and bake for 10 minutes. Turn down the temperature to
        190°C/170°C fan/Gas 5 and bake for another 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the buns from the oven and turn the oven off. Slice each bun in
        half and put the buns cut side up back on to the baking sheet. Return to
        the oven for 15–20 minutes to dry out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the buns have dried out and are crisp, dip one half into the
        chocolate sauce and place on a wire rack to set. Repeat with 11 bun
        tops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the cream into a large bowl and whisk until it forms soft peaks.
        Place a generous dollop of whipped cream on to the remaining bun halves,
        then sandwich a chocolate half on top. Repeat to make 12 profiteroles.
      </li>
    </ol>
