    <h2>Make delicious macarons!</h2>
    <p>
      French macarons are delicate sandwich cookies with a crisp exterior. Each
      individual cookie is known as a macaron shell. The shells are made without
      any chemical leaveners and get all of their lift from properly beaten egg
      whites. If you follow the recipe carefully, the cookies have a unique
      nougat-like, chewy texture. They should not be hollow. You can flavor
      macarons many ways, but this recipe is for plain macarons. They taste like
      sweet almond and they’re delicious! You can always have fun with different
      flavorful fillings such as vanilla buttercream, lemon buttercream, salted
      caramel, or chocolate ganache.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there’s one thing to know before baking French macarons at home, it’s
      this: these cookies require precision, patience, and practice. I’m going
      to do my best to prepare any French macaron beginner. You can do this!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>100g egg whites</li>
      <li>1g cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>80g caster sugar</li>
      <li>125 almond flour</li>
      <li>125 confectione's sugar</li>
      <li>desired macaron filling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wipe down a large glass or metal mixing bowl with lemon juice or
        vinegar. Add egg whites. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, then bring
        to room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 3 large baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
        Set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cream of tartar and extract (if using) to egg whites. Using a
        handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat
        together on medium speed until very soft peaks form. This takes a few
        minutes of beating. At first the egg white and cream of tartar mixture
        will be foamy, then the bubbles will begin to tighten and the beaters
        will leave tracks as the egg whites build volume. Once they begin
        leaving tracks, you likely have soft peaks. Stop beating. Add about 1/3
        of the superfine sugar. Beat on medium-high speed for 5 seconds, then
        with the mixer continuing to run, add another 1/3 of the sugar. Beat for
        5 seconds, then with the mixer continuing to run, add the remaining
        sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form. (This
        means the whites have stiff, smooth, and sharp points in the bowl or on
        the lifted whisk attachment/beaters. Stiff peaks do not droop down. You
        can turn the bowl upside down and the egg whites will not move or spill
        out.) Using a rubber spatula, slowly and gently fold the food coloring
        (if using) into the egg whites.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the almond flour and confectioners’ sugar together in a large glass
        or metal mixing bowl. Use a spoon to help work any larger pieces through
        the sieve. You don’t want to discard a lot of that because then you
        won’t have enough dry ingredients in the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly fold the beaten egg whites into the almond flour mixture in 3
        separate additions, folding until combined before adding the next
        addition. After you add all of the egg whites, pay very close attention
        to the consistency of your macaron batter. Continue folding the batter
        (which deflates air) until it thins out into the consistency of honey.
        What’s a more helpful cue is the figure 8 test. Drop the macaron batter
        off of your spatula in the form of a figure 8. The figure 8 should take
        no more than 10 seconds to sink back into itself. If it takes less, your
        batter was overmixed and is too thin. If it takes longer, continue
        slowly folding the batter to deflate more air, then perform the figure 8
        test again. It’s best to go very slow so you don’t accidentally overmix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a medium round
        piping tip, such as Wilton 12, Wilton 1A, or even Ateco 806. The macaron
        batter is very drippy, so transferring to the piping bag can be messy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Holding the piping bag at a 90 degree angle over the baking sheet, pipe
        batter in 1.5 – 2 inch rounds about 1-2 inches apart on prepared baking
        sheets. I usually pipe little mounds– see video tutorial above. The
        piped macaron batter flattens out. Bang the pan a couple times on the
        counter to pop any air bubbles, then use a toothpick to pop any
        remaining air bubbles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the piped macarons sit out until they are dry and no longer tacky on
        top, usually 30-60 minutes. This time allows the top to firm up and form
        a skin, which helps the macarons rise UP and form their trademark ruffly
        “feet.” Do not let them sit out for longer than they need to because
        they could begin to deflate.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake for 13 minutes. As the macaron shells bake, they should form feet.
        To test for doneness, lightly touch the top of a macaron with a spoon or
        your finger (careful, it’s hot). If the macaron seems wobbly, it’s not
        done and needs another 1-2 minutes. If it seems set, it’s done.
        Basically, bake until the macarons don’t move around when touched.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the shells cool on the baking sheet for 15 minutes, then transfer to
        a cooling rack to continue cooling. The macaron shells may stick to the
        parchment paper/baking sheet if you try to remove them too early. If
        this is happening, let them cool on the baking sheet a little longer
        before removing.
      </li>
      <li>
        After cooling, the shells are ready to fill and sandwich together. I
        have plenty of filling suggestions in the recipe notes below. You can
        spread filling with a knife or pipe it using the same round tip you used
        for the macaron batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can eat right away or, as some professionals prefer, cover and
        refrigerate them 12-24 hours so the macarons and flavors can mature.
        Bring to room temperature before serving. (I usually just serve them
        right away!)
      </li>
      <li>Cover leftover macarons and refrigerate for up to 5 days.</li>
