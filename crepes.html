    <h2>Make delicious french crepes!</h2>
    <p>
      French crêpes are good for weekend breakfasts, or even for desserts. Serve
      rolled up and filled with jam or fruit and whipped cream.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs and milk
        together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in flour mixture
        until smooth; stir in melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease a griddle or frying pan; heat over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2
        tablespoons for each crêpe. Immediately rotate the skillet to spread
        batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer
        wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Shake the pan
        or loosen with a spatula; turn or flip it over and cook until other side
        has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining
        batter.
      </li>
    </ol>
